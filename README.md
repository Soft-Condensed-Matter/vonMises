von Mises Probability density function
=======

* [ `von Mises distribution` ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises_distribution#cite_note-Mardia99-2):
  In probability theory and directional statistics, the von Mises distribution 
  (also known as the circular normal distribution or Tikhonov distribution) 
  is a continuous probability distribution on the circle.


  For an angle $x$ the function is given by:

  $$ f(x; \mu, \kappa) = \frac{\exp \left(\kappa \right)}{2 \pi I_{0}(\kappa)}$$
